----------- USAGES -----------------------------------

A) PSD Experiments

Parameters in htree/Params.py
    
    DATASET: name of the dataset, e.g., "yelp"
    + PercentSplit: budget allocated for split
    + splitFrac: splitting budget percentage for 1st level, (1-splitFrac) for 2nd level
    + minPartSizeHTree: maximum number of data points in a leaf node
    + dynamicGranularity: compute granularity of the htree automatically
    + c_htree: a constant for computing granularity automatically
    + CONSTRAINT_INFERENCE: applying constraint inference (for both htrees and grids)
    + partitionsHTree: maximum size of the htree
    + switchPartitionsHTree: determine the size of first level tree (used for both h-trees and grids)
    + nQuery: the number of queries
    + queryUnit: the maximum query size
    + IS_LOGGING: enable logging individual query result

Parameters in PSDExp.py (starting point is at the end)
    seed_list: an array of seeds
    shape_list: an array of query size (the maximum query size is queryUnit in htree/Params.py)
    eps_list: an array of budgets

Run experiments with the following command
>> python PSDExp.py

The aggregated estimation error is in the corresponding folder in ../output/ (see the PSD RESULT)

The core dump estimation error is in folder ../log/. Each file is associated with a method. (see the CORE DUMP)

The debug file is in exp/debug.log

B) Geocast Experiments
>> python GeocastExp.py

----------- PSD RESULT --------------------------------------

Each file contains aggregated results of nQuery*size(seed_list) queries.

Data in each file is in tabular format. Rows are corresponding to budgets (i.e., eps_list) 
while columns are corresponding to PSD variants (method_list in PSDExp.py)

----------- PSD CORE DUMP -----------------------------------

Each file in ../log/ dumps the following information: query coordinates, query area (square km), values,  errors

    Format

    minLat    minLng    maxLat    maxLng    area    real_val    est_val    abs_err    rel_err

----------- GEOCAST CORE DUMP -------------------------------

    File name: geocast_{eps}.log
    Each line format: <is_assigned, #cells, lat lon, cell_1 info, cell_2 info....>
    1, 1, -120.081499 47.863793, 1 4 4 33 678 674.4 3.2 1.0 1.0
    1, 2, -108.865274 32.231816, 3 0 23 9 75 47.1 2.1 0.906 0.906, 3 0 23 8 154 190.7 2.9 1.0 1.0

    Info of each cell includes: <k l i j  #workers noisy_count cost u_c u  >
        >> (k, l): index of the first level grid
        >> (i, j): index of the second level grid (in case level = 2), i,j=1 means this is the first level cell
        >> cost: distance between the task and the cell's center
        >> u_c: utility of the cell
        >> u: updated utility
